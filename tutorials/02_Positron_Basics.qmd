# Introduction

Now that you have installed the tools, let's get comfortable with **Positron**. Positron is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed specifically for data science, supporting both R and Python seamlessly.

<div class="note">
<strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have successfully completed <a href="01_Setup_Installation.html">Tutorial 1: Setup and Installation</a> and can run <code>quarto check</code> without errors.
</div>

# The Interface

When you open Positron, you'll see a layout similar to VS Code or RStudio.

<div class="step-box">
<span class="step-number">1</span> **The Activity Bar (Left)**

The narrow vertical strip on the far left contains icons for different views:

*   **Explorer** (Files icon): Browse and manage your project files and folders.
*   **Search** (Magnifying glass): Search across all files in your project.
*   **Source Control** (Git branch): Manage Git version control if your project is under Git.
*   **Extensions** (Puzzle piece): Browse and install extensions to add functionality.
*   **Positron** (P icon): Access Positron-specific features and settings.

**Tip:** Click any icon to switch to that view. The active view is highlighted.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<span class="step-number">2</span> **The Editor (Center)**

The main area where you write and edit code, text, and Quarto documents (`.qmd` files).

*   **Tabbed Interface**: Each open file appears as a tab at the top.
*   **Syntax Highlighting**: Code is colored according to the language (R, Python, Markdown).
*   **Code Completion**: Press `Tab` or `Ctrl+Space` for suggestions as you type.
*   **Live Preview**: For Quarto documents, you can see a live preview of the rendered output.

**Tip:** You can split the editor vertically or horizontally to view multiple files side by side.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<span class="step-number">3</span> **The Console / Terminal Area (Bottom)**

The bottom panel contains several useful tools:

*   **Terminal**: A system shell (Command Prompt, PowerShell, bash, or zsh) for running system commands.
*   **R Console**: An interactive R session where you can run R commands line by line.
*   **Python REPL**: An interactive Python session (REPL - Read-Eval-Print Loop).
*   **Output**: Shows output from rendering Quarto documents or running scripts.
*   **Problems**: Displays errors and warnings from your code.

**Tip:** Click the tabs at the bottom to switch between these panels. You can also drag the top edge to resize the panel.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<span class="step-number">4</span> **Sidebar Panels (Right)**

The right sidebar contains several useful panels that can be toggled:

*   **Environment**: Shows variables, data frames, and objects currently loaded in your R or Python session.
*   **Help**: Displays documentation for R functions or Python modules when you search or click `F1`.
*   **Plots**: Shows plots and visualizations generated by your code.
*   **Files**: Alternative file browser (also available in Explorer).
*   **Git**: Visual Git interface if your project is version controlled.

**Tip:** Click the icons at the far right edge of the window to show/hide these panels.

# Setting Up the Project

<div class="step-box">
<span class="step-number">1</span> **Open Folder**

Go to `File` -> `Open Folder...`.
Navigate to your `Math495Spring26` folder and select it.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<span class="step-number">2</span> **Trust the Authors**

If prompted, click "Yes, I trust the authors" since this is your own project folder.
</div>

<div class="note">
<strong>Why Projects?</strong>
Opening the <em>folder</em> as a project ensures that Positron knows where your files are relative to each other. This fixes many "File not found" errors!
</div>

# Navigating Files

In the **Explorer** pane (left side), you should now see the course files. The Explorer shows the folder structure of your `Math495Spring26` project.

<div class="step-box">
<span class="step-number">1</span> **Expand Folders**

Click the small triangles (▸) next to folder names to expand them and see their contents.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<span class="step-number">2</span> **Key Files and Folders**

You'll see important course files:

*   `lecture1_data_management.qmd` - First lecture on data management
*   `lecture2_statistical_analysis.qmd` - Second lecture on statistical analysis
*   `MATH495_Spring26_ConsultingCourse/` - Contains the poultry litter dataset and supporting files
*   `Tutorials/` - These tutorial files you're working with now
</div>

<div class="tip">
<strong>Try it:</strong>
1.  Double-click on `lecture1_data_management.qmd` to open it in the editor.
2.  Notice how the file name appears as a tab at the top of the editor.
3.  Try opening a different file (like `lecture2_statistical_analysis.qmd`) to see multiple tabs.
</div>

<div class="note">
<strong>Quick Navigation:</strong>
Use `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+P` (Mac) to quickly search and open files by name.
</div>
